## Hangman

As a child, I always enjoyed playing hangman. This game is an simple online version of the hangman version I played as a child. 

## Approach
 1. I chose the movie theme because I love to watch movies. I enjoy old black and white movies as well as the new releases.
 2. I chose a sub-category of movies, focusing on the movies that won the Movie of the Year award in the last 10 years. 
 3. I created an array of objects. Each object included the movie name, year, as well as parameters I needed to track during the game. 
 4. Once I wrote the code to display the contents of the object, I began working on the logic of ensuring that the number of blanks (dashes) represented the movie name. 
 5. Then I wrote the logic to fill in the blanks as the player provided a correct letter. 
 
## My Challenges
 1. I ran into a few challenges:
      a. Ensuring that when a letter occurred more than once in the title, that it would display correctly.
      b. Starting the game over.
